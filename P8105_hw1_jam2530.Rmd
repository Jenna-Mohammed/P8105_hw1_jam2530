# Problem 1

```{r}
mean()
```


There are 358 rows, where the information is collected every hour from hour 1 to hour 23. 


```{r}
plot_df = tibble(
    x = "time_hour",
    y = "temp"

)

ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour , y = temp , color = humid )) + geom_point()
                                                                              
```




# Problem 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
